            <h1>Nana Fujita</h1>
            <h2>Graphics/Game Programmer</h2>

            <p>My name is Nanae (Nana) Fujita. Currently, I'm studying Computer Science Games and Environmental Science at the University of Southern California (graduating December 2024).<br><br>
            I have experience working on projects developing mobile and PC games on Unreal Engine and Unity, as well as developing unique graphics with shaders in Unity. I have worked as a graphics programming engineer at a video game startup, and as a UI engineer on a published video game.<br><br>
            My love for nature and the environment fuels my interest in recreating the many beautiful, curious phenomenon of this planet on computer screens.</p>
